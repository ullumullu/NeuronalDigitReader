# Neuronal Digit Reader

I read through http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com and wanted to do some hands on coding... in Java to combine two _personal_ goals:

1. Hands on working on AI topics
2. Write some Java as in the good old days

Hence this project has and will never have the intention to be used near production workloads.
